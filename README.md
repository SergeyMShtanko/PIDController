This is a python 3.5 script.

First program I've ever completed. All of this work is original and fully represents my python programming skill level at the date of posting.
The program includes a model of a process. In this case I was motivated by the idea of a short and wide tank with a level sensor and a valve FCE. Normally the efflux rate would be a function of fluid level in the tank given by C*sqrt(waterHeight), but in this case I chose to ignore it in favor of a linear system for testing.
